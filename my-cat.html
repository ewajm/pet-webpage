      Hello, my name is <em>theoretically</em> Persephone,
      but you can call me Admiral Jerkface. I am a <strong>cat</strong>.
      The stripe-y kind.

      I <em>hope</em> we can meet one day. But not really because I will probably just hide or try to bite you. If you'd like to adopt your own cuddly, biting friend please visit <a href="http://catadoptionteam.org">Cat Adoption Team</a> or the <a href="http://oregonhumane.org">Oregon Humane Society</a>. Also check out <a href="my-lizard.html">this lizard's web page</a>.  I would hunt this lizard. I would be terrible at it. But by golly I would try.
